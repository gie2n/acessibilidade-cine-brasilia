                    <h3>Cine Brasília was conceived as a neighborhood cinema to accompany the model project of the first residential blocks of Brasília. It is the oldest cinema in the capital and was inaugurated on April 22, 1960, one day after the city’s founding.

                <div>
                    <h3>The building was designed by Oscar Niemeyer and aligns with the city's original aesthetic proposal: a bucolic, tree-lined space with ample room. It’s an old-fashioned cinema, not located in a shopping mall, as is usually the case. </h3>
                    <h3>Cine Brasília is one of the most important film exhibition centers in Latin America. It screens feature and short films, organizes thematic festivals and exhibitions, holds children’s sessions, and offers lectures and educational activities with prominent national and international figures. Its programming is diverse, having shown films from 52 countries in more than 30 languages.</h3>
